## Project Plan

### Phase 1: Core Functionality Development and Google Docs Integration

#### 1. Project Setup and Initial Configuration
- **Create Project Repositories**: Establish a repository for frontend and backend code.
- **Setup Development Environments**: Each developer sets up their local environment with necessary tools (IDEs, Docker, etc.).
- **CI/CD Setup**: Configure pipelines for automated testing and deployment using Jenkins, CircleCI, or GitHub Actions.

#### 2. Backend Development
- **Flask Application Setup**:
  - Initialize a new Flask project with structured folder layout.
  - Configuration management for different environments (development, staging, production).
- **Database Design and Integration**:
